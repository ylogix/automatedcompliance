The Automated Control Testing (ACT) Framework Project

The Problem to Solve

Sampling sucks because anecdotes aren’t data
Without data, patterns can’t be identified
Manual testing is infrequent
Impossible to measure the effectiveness of corrective feedback or remediation projects when sampling
Many teams performing 2nd line of defense spend 80% of their time testing and 20% of their time consulting/advising with the 1st  and/or 3rd line of defense

Why Do it?

Marketing Differentiator – Your organization working hard at making compliance and risk management significantly more effective conveys a story about your values that is not possible to tell through normal marketing avenues.
Drive Conversation – Open-source is a way to engage a broad group of people. Some of the conversations are about design and implementation issues directly associated with the ACT Framework, but there are many other indirect opportunities for an organization to learn.
Nurture Innovation – By working with others you benefit from their novel ideas on how to solve problems and challenges. This can help you identify new features for development, create positive publicity, and spur your own innovations.
Design Help – User feedback, coupled with the open-source practice of incremental development and frequent releases, helps keep the Framework in touch with reality and focused on what adds value.

Legal Considerations

Giving away company assets (your time) is as much a legal issue as anything else. The very first conversation should be with an appropriate member of your company’s legal team to discuss the ins and outs of open-sourcing and your participating in it. In larger companies, one or more intellectual property (IP) attorneys are likely on staff or on retainer; in smaller companies, this conversation might start with the general counsel. In either case, it’s important to lay out exactly what you want to do.

Where are we going?

The ACT Framework Project aims to create automated tests for select NIST 800-53 procedural control activities by consuming data from the default supported versions of ServiceNow, JIRA, Jenkins, and more.

The full ACT Framework Project vision statement is defined in the VISION.md file. Please read it to understand the features, goals, and philosophy of the project.

The ACT Project Roadmap shows prioritization of development though contributions need not adhere to the Roadmap so long as they align with project vision statement.

Rules of the Road

How a contribution is reviewed and accepted (Do they need tests? An issue template?)
The types of contributions you’ll accept (Do you only want help with a certain part of your code?)
When it’s appropriate to follow up (for example, “You can expect a response from a maintainer within 7 days. If you haven’t heard anything by then, feel free to ping the thread.”)
How much time you spend on the project (for example, “We only spend about 5 hours per week on this project”)

Who can participate?

Anyone!

Coding is only part of the project; many more artifacts need to be developed. Documentation on topics like:

How to use the Framework
Working with customized instances of ServiceNow, JIRA, etc
Policies on how to use ACT data in your own organization
Procedures on how to interact with 1st and 3rd Lines of Defense using ACT data
Presentations on how to communicate the use and value of the ACT Framework to executives
