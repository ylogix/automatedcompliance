# automatedcompliance
A Framweork based in Excel VBA Libraries for use in the performance of semi-automated monitoring controls.

See releases for examples of the Framework in use and additional materials to assist in designing semi-automated monitoring controls.

The principles used for this project include:
  - Prioritize accessibility over operational maturity: While there are better solutions for an operational capability but everyone has Excel. Furthermore, it can be used as a "proof-of-value" for the requisition of products that are better aligned with a robust operational capability.
  - Each Excel file is a monitoring control for the effectiveness of a cyber security technology (a technical control) or part of a process/workflow supported by some other system (administrative control)
